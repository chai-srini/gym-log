## Q3: Do you want to view historical workout data and track progress over time?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (tracking progress is a core motivation for logging workouts)

## Q4: Will this app be used by just you, or do you need multi-user support?
**Default if unknown:** No (personal workout logging apps are typically single-user)
